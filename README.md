# 🚀 Student Performance Prediction and Analysis 🧠📊

Welcome to the **Student Performance Prediction and Analysis** repository—a place where data science meets the drama of student life! Whether you're here to flex your ML skills or just curious about what makes students tick (spoiler: it’s probably coffee), this repo has got you covered.

## 🎯 What’s This About?
Ever wondered why some students ace everything while others are just here for attendance? This project dives into the nitty-gritty of student performance data, using machine learning wizardry and data analysis magic to make predictions and insights that might just blow your mind. 📈✨

## 🔥 Features
- **🛠 Data Cleaning**: Because messy data is like unwashed dishes—nobody likes it.
- **📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Pretty graphs to impress your boss, professor, or random internet strangers.
- **🤖 Performance Prediction**: Machine learning models that predict student success faster than students Googling answers during exams.
- **💻 Interactive Notebooks**: Jupyter Notebooks for those who like their data science with a side of interactivity.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Before you dive in, make sure you have:
- Python (because who doesn’t these days? 🐍)
- Jupyter Notebook (your new best friend)
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn` (yes, the usual suspects)

### Installation
1. Clone this repo like it’s your favorite meme:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/salsabil213/Student-Performance-Prediction-and-Analysis-.git
   ```
2. CD into the repo like a pro:
   ```bash
   cd Student-Performance-Prediction-and-Analysis-
   ```
3. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Add Your Data
Got data? Awesome. Drop it in the `data/` folder—it’s like the VIP section for datasets.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Because who doesn’t love a good notebook?
- **Python**: The Beyoncé of programming languages.
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas`: For data wrangling (yee-haw 🤠).
  - `numpy`: For crunching numbers like a champ.
  - `matplotlib` & `seaborn`: For making your data look like art.
  - `scikit-learn`: For teaching machines how to learn (no textbooks required).

## 📖 How to Use
1. Fire up Jupyter Notebook (🔥):
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. Open one of the notebooks and start running cells like you’re on a coding speedrun.
3. Tweak, analyze, predict, and take all the credit when it works. 🎉
